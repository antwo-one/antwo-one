## I am a lifelong learner with a strong attention to details and a passion for technology

On my free time, I sometimes work on my various pet projects: my blog, PIBS, boot2cv and Linux Faces.  
Most of those projects are not public yet but I hope to open-source them soon, when they reach v1.0 stable version.
That said, if you are adventurous and curious, you might find some clues about those projects by looking on this page ðŸ¤«


I love to discover and run old software and operating system!  
Thanks to modern web and browsers and the hard work of good fellows, it is now possible without even installing any software.  
Here are my favourite pre-configured and pre-packaged in-browser emulation pages:

ðŸ’¾ Classic mainstream operating system:
 - https://copy.sh/v86/ : Windows3.1, 95, 98, 2000 and a lot of alternative non-mainstream operating system like KolibriOS, Plan9, Haiku, QNX, ReactOS, etc.
 - https://infinitemac.org : SystemX and MacOS from 1984 to 1999, pre-loaded with tons of software and games, there are even some NeXTStep versions to play with
 - https://distrosea.com : OpenIndiana and lots of up-to-date Linux distributions

ðŸ‘´ Old and sometimes exotic OS and softwares:
 - https://www.pcjs.org : lots of old software, operating systems, and a few games 
 
ðŸŽ® Massive DOS game archive, full games and demos:
  - https://dos.zone/
  - https://classicreload.com/
  - https://www.playdosgames.com/
