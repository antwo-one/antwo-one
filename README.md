## I am a lifelong learner with a strong attention to details and a passion for technology

### I have more than 15 years of professional experience and currently work as an infrastructure and cloud specialist for a Global 500 company. 

I love to discover and run old software and operating system!  
Thanks to modern web and browsers and the hard work of some good lads, it is now possible without even installing any software.  
Here are my favourite pre-configured and pre-packaged in-browser emulation pages:
 - https://www.pcjs.org : lots of old software, operating systems, and a few games
 - https://copy.sh/v86/ : Windows3.1, 95, 98, 2000 and a lot of alternative non-mainstream operating system like KolibriOS, Plan9 (9front), Haiku, QNX, ReactOS, etc.
 - https://infinitemac.org : SystemX and MacOS from 1984 to 1999, pre-loaded with tons of software and games, there are even some NeXTStep versions to play with
 - https://distrosea.com : mainly up-to-date Linux distributions, but there is also Open Indiana, based on (Open)Solaris if you want to try something different
 - http://www.boxedwine.org/search-apps/ : Some online demo of linux+wine running Windows (mostly games)
Massive DOS game archive, full games and demos:
  - https://dos.zone/
  - https://classicreload.com/
  - https://www.playdosgames.com/
  - https://bestdosgames.com

On my free time, I sometimes work on my various pet projects: my blog, PIBS, boot2cv and Linux Faces.  
Those projects are not public yet but I hope to open-source them soon, when they reach v1.0 stable version.
